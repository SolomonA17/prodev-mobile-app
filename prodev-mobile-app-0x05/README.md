### Your Expo Project Awaits!

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project, created with `create-expo-app`.

---

### Getting Started

1.  **Install dependencies**
    To get started, open your terminal and install all the necessary packages for your project:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the app**
    Once the installation is complete, start the development server with this command:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    This will give you several options for viewing your app:

    * **Development Build**: A custom app that includes the dependencies you've installed, great for testing native code.
    * **Android Emulator / iOS Simulator**: Virtual devices for testing your app on Android and iOS without needing a physical phone.
    * **Expo Go**: A limited sandbox you can use to quickly test your project on your phone.

    You can start building your app by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), where your file structure directly determines your app's navigation.

### Starting Fresh

If you're ready to clear out the example code and start from scratch, run the following command:

```bash
npm run reset-project
