# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with `create-expo-app`.

---

## Get Started

1.  **Install dependencies**
    Run this command in your terminal to install the necessary packages for your project:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the app**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with the following command:
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```
    You'll see a list of options to open the app:

    * **Development build**: A custom app that includes the native dependencies you've installed.
    * **Android emulator** / **iOS simulator**: Virtual devices for testing your app on Android and iOS.
    * **Expo Go**: A limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo.

    You can begin developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), so the file structure directly determines your app's navigation.
